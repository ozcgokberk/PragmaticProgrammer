# PragmaticProgrammer
Chapter 1 -------------------------------
Another key to their success is that they take responsibility for everything they
do. Being responsible, Pragmatic Programmers won't sit idly by and watch their
projects fall apart through neglect.
One of the benefits of understanding the context in which you work is that it becomes easier to know just how good your software has to be. Sometimes near-perfection is the only option, but often there are trade-offs involved

Finally, none of us works in a vacuum. We all spend a large amount of time interacting with others. Communicate! lists ways we can do this better.
1.1----

One of the cornerstones of the pragmatic philosophy is the idea of taking responsibility 
for yourself and your actions in terms of your career advancement, your project, and your 
day-to-day work. A Pragmatic Programmer takes charge of his or her own career, and isn't 
afraid to admit ignorance or error.

You have the right not to take on a responsibility for an impossible situation, or one in 
which the risks are too great. You'll have to make the call based on your own ethics and 
judgment.

Before you approach anyone to tell them why you cant do, ask yourself questions.
Instead of excuses, provide options. Dont say it cant be done, explain what can be done 
to salvage the situation.
There are many factors that can contribute to software rot. The most important one seems 
to be the psychology, or culture, at work on a project

Broken Window theory : 
This story is important to me because it gives the main idea of this theory;

The "Broken Window Theory" has inspired police departments in New York and other major 
cities to crack down on the small stuff in order to keep out the big stuff. It works: 
keeping on top of broken windows, graffiti, and other small infractions has reduced the 
serious crime level.

Don't leave "broken windows" (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired. Fix 
each one as soon as it is discovered.  If there is insufficient time to fix it properly, 
then board it up. 
Putting out Fires :
If you find yourself working on a project with quite a few broken windows, it's all too 
easy to slip into the mindset of "All the rest of this code is crap, I'll just follow 
suit." It doesn't matter if the project has been fine up to this point. In the original 
experiment leading to the "Broken Window Theory," an abandoned car sat for a week 
untouched. But once a single window was broken, the car was stripped and turned upside 
down within hours.
----Be a Catalyst for Change
It's often the accumulation of small things that breaks morale and teams.
----Remember the Big Picture
It is unprofessional to ignore these users' requirements simply to add new features to the program, or to polsih up the ode just one more time. Also it is unprofessional to promise impossible time scales and the cut basic engineering corners to meet a deadline.
So that, the scope and quailty of the system you produce should be specified as part ıf that systems requirements.
----Make Quality a Requirements Issue
We need to give our users something to play with early, their feedback will often lead us to 
better eventual solution. In today's world, great software of today is often preferable to 
perfect software tomorrow.
----Know when to stop
all the hard work is ruined if we don't know when to stop. If we add layer upon layer, detail 
over detail, the painting becomes lost in the paint.
Building Porfolio Guidelines ;
Invest Regularly,
Diversify,
Manage Risk,
Buy low, Sell high
Review and rebalance
----Oppurtunities for learning : 
If you dont know the answer, find a guru in office. If you do not have guru in your office
then find it on internet.
----Critical Thinking:
The last important point is to think critically about what you read and hear. You need to
ensure that the knowledge in your portfolio is accurate and unswayed by either vendor or
media hype.
Never underestimate the power of commercialism.
Always need to critically analyze what you read and hear.  
----Choose your Moment : 
Ask yourself "Is this a good time to talk about"

----Choose A Style :
When it comes to written documents, some like to receive large bound reports, while
others expect a simple memo or e-mail. If in doubt, ask.
Communication is the key for learn people style.
----Make It Look Good
It is important to forward your ideas to audience properly also good loking.
Also it is important to create content with good style.
----Involve Your Auidience: 

We often find that the documents we produce end up being less important than the process
we go through to produce them. If possible, involve your readers with early drafts of
your document. Get their feedback.

----Be A Listener: 
If you do not listen to people, they won't listen to you either.
----Get Back To People:
It is important to get back to people's email or message even if you say "I will get back 
to you later". Its key of being polite person.
!!It's both what you say and the way you say it.

Summary of Chapter 1: 
✅Know what you want to say.
✅Know your audience.
✅Choose your moment.
✅Choose a style.
✅Make it look good.
✅Involve your audience.
✅Be a listener.
✅Get back to people.
