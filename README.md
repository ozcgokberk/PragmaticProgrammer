# PragmaticProgrammer
Chapter 1 -------------------------------
Another key to their success is that they take responsibility for everything they
do. Being responsible, Pragmatic Programmers won't sit idly by and watch their
projects fall apart through neglect.
One of the benefits of understanding the context in which you work is that it becomes easier to know just how good your software has to be. Sometimes near-perfection is the only option, but often there are trade-offs involved

Finally, none of us works in a vacuum. We all spend a large amount of time interacting with others. Communicate! lists ways we can do this better.
1.1----

One of the cornerstones of the pragmatic philosophy is the idea of taking responsibility for yourself and your actions in terms of your career advancement, your project, and your day-to-day work. A Pragmatic Programmer takes charge of his or her own career, and isn't afraid to admit ignorance or error.
You have the right not to take on a responsibility for an impossible situation, or one in which the risks are too great. You'll have to make the call based on your own ethics and judgment.
Before you approach anyone to tell them why you cant do, ask yourself questions.
Instead of excuses, provide options. Dont say it cant be done, explain what can be done to salvage the situation.
There are many factors that can contribute to software rot. The most important one seems to be the psychology, or culture, at work on a project

Broken Window theory : 

The "Broken Window Theory" has inspired police departments in New York and other major cities to crack down on the small stuff in order to keep out the big stuff. It works: keeping on top of broken windows, graffiti, and other small infractions has reduced the serious crime level.
Don't leave "broken windows" (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired. Fix each one as soon as it is discovered.  If there is insufficient time to fix it properly, then board it up. 
Putting out Fires :
If you find yourself working on a project with quite a few broken windows, it's all too easy to slip into the mindset of "All the rest of this code is crap, I'll just follow suit." It doesn't matter if the project has been fine up to this point. In the original experiment leading to the "Broken Window Theory," an abandoned car sat for a week untouched. But once a single window was broken, the car was stripped and turned upside down within hours.
